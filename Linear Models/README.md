The `LinearRegression` class serves as a comprehensive learning tool designed to offer deep insights into the workings of a Linear Regression Machine Learning Model. Key features of this class include:

- **Cost Propagation**: Enables tracking of the cost function's value across iterations, providing a clear indicator of the model's convergence and performance improvement over time.

- **Weights Propagation**: Offers visibility into the progression of model weights with each iteration, illustrating the dynamic adjustments made by the gradient descent optimization process.

- **Bias Propagation**: Allows observation of bias modifications throughout the training cycle, highlighting the continual refinement of the model's intercept term in response to data.

This class is crafted to demystify the internal mechanics of linear regression, making it an invaluable resource for learners and practitioners aiming to gain a deeper understanding of model training and optimization techniques.
